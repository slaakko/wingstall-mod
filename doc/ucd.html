<h1>Making Wingstall Unicode Database</h1>

<p>The Wingstall Unicode database is used by the <strong>util</strong> library that is used by all Wingstall tools and libraries.
It is located in the <strong>%WINGSTALL_ROOT/unicode</strong> directory.
Here are instructions how to generate the Unicode database files:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Extract the ucd.all.flat.zip (extracts to ucd.all.flat.xml)</p></li>
<li><p>Run make_wingstall_ucd.exe</p></li>
<li><p>The make_wingstall_ucd program generates two files:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>wingstall_ucd.bin
contains uncompressed Unicode database</p></li>
<li><p>wingstall_ucd.deflate.bin
contains Unicode database compressed with zlib</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now the Wingstall Unicode database is ready for use by the Wingstall tools and libraries.</p></li>
</ul>
