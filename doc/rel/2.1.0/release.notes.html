<h1>Wingstall 2.1.0 for Windows x64</h1>

<h2>Release notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Wingstall versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 did not work at all so I decided to remove them from SourceForge.
Their initialization code depended on an environment variable named WINGSTALL_ROOT being defined 
in the machine. If that was not the case the installer crashed. This is now fixed.
Apologies to those who downloaded it and tried to use it.</p></li>
<li><p>The package editor does not support creation of preinstall and uninstall components but they are
now carried in the package XML if they are defined.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: fixed a bug in Path::ChangeExtension function.</p></li>
</ul>
